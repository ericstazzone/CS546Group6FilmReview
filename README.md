Introduction
For our project, we propose a platform for film self-reviews. Users will be required to create accounts in order to upload reviews. When uploading reviews, users will be presented with a form with numerous fields to fill out, including film title, rating, and review body. Film title is to be matched with entries pulled from a third-party API. Users can browse reviews via the central catalog page and sort by such categories as title and reviewer. Users can also view pages dedicated to individual reviews.
